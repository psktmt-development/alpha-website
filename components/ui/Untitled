🎯 Cursor Prompt — Gallery Page with Left Sidebar Filter & Right Image Grid

Context
The current Gallery page shows Year and Event filters centered at the top, but this layout feels visually heavy and unbalanced.
We want to redesign the Gallery page layout to match a sidebar-style filter pattern, similar to the Blog page UI.

🔹 Objective

Redesign the Gallery page so that:

Filters live in a left sidebar

Gallery images appear on the right side

The layout feels clean, structured, and editorial (like a blog or magazine layout)

🔹 Required Page Layout
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

🔹 Sidebar Filter Requirements (Left Column)

Fixed width (≈ 280–320px)

Vertically stacked sections:

Year filter (radio-style or pill buttons)

Event filter (list or pill-style buttons)

Clear section headings:

“YEAR”

“EVENTS”

Filters should:

Be left-aligned

Feel lightweight and scannable

Sidebar should:

Stick while scrolling (position: sticky; top: navbarHeight)

Scroll independently if content overflows

🔹 Gallery Content Area (Right Column)

Takes remaining width (flex-1)

Displays:

Image grid (2–4 columns depending on screen size)

Masonry or uniform grid

Filters should dynamically update images (existing logic stays intact)

🔹 Layout Implementation Rules

Use a two-column layout:

display: grid or flex

Suggested grid:

grid-template-columns: 300px 1fr;


Wrap both columns inside a max-w-7xl mx-auto container

Maintain consistent spacing with the rest of the site

🔹 Sticky Behaviour

Sidebar:

position: sticky

top should account for navbar height

Navbar behavior remains unchanged

No overlap between sidebar and navbar

🔹 Visual & UX Constraints

Sidebar background: white or very light neutral

Subtle divider between sidebar and gallery

No shadows that feel “card-heavy”

Clean, editorial look (similar to Blog page)

❌ What NOT to Do

❌ Do not keep filters centered above the gallery

❌ Do not overlay filters on images

❌ Do not collapse filters into dropdowns on desktop

❌ Do not affect Blog page styles

✅ Expected Result

Filters feel like a navigation tool, not content

Gallery images get full visual priority

Page feels balanced, premium, and readable

UX consistency with Blog layout
